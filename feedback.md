The data that you have left over is fairly clean, but you dropped a lot of essential columns. We are handling traffic incidents, but you dropped the columns containing the second, third, fourth and fifth car info. 
These contain a lot of nan values, but it makes sense for them given the context; not every incident involves multiple cars.

The code you used for basic cleaning operations I have seen before, which is not that big of a deal, if it was good code. The final data also lacks things like one hot encoding or other scaling operations.
Overall, it's not too bad, but I would have like to see more.
