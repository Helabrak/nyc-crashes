# nyc-crashes
Description: 

Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, is in a bit of a pickle. Indeed, his police department, the NYPD, collected information about all the traffic accidents that happened in New York City. However, they are too busy eating doughnuts to correctly encode each traffic incident, and so it happens that the dataset that we got here is quite dirty, has a lot of missing values and can't be used by a machine learning model as is. the main goal is to clean the New york city crashes data and predict which streets are the most dangerous while visiting NYC
