# nyc-crashes
Description: 

Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, is in a bit of a pickle. Indeed, his police department, the NYPD, collected information about all the traffic accidents that happened in New York City. However, they are too busy eating doughnuts to correctly encode each traffic incident, and so it happens that the dataset that we got here is quite dirty, has a lot of missing values and can't be used by a machine learning model as is. the main goal is to clean the New york city crashes data and predict which streets are the most dangerous while visiting NYC


Installation: 
  Pandas and numpy



Usage:
After having installed all the necessary components to run the code, it is time to run it! How ? Well, you have to specify that.
Here is also the time to showcase your most important piece of code and how it is used.

Visuals
Posting your code is good, but putting a little preview in the form of a screenshot (or even just your application logo) is a small touch that goes a long way. And a link to an online demo is even more stylish!

Contributors
If a project was done in a group, but only one person saved the repo, it is useful to link to their Github profile for completeness.

Timeline
When did you work on the project ? Was it yesterday or three years ago? The GitHub repo will certainly mention the dates but it's still more pleasant to read when a human explains that the website showcasing the grey shrimp lovers was made during the summer of 2015 during a hackathon that took place in Miribel.

Personal situation
What were you doing? During your career as a developer, you will probably have to work in several companies. It is helpful to know for what company you are writing a given software or if it is a personal project.
